	  Enable driver for Kinetic KTD2026/KTD2027 I2C RGB/RGBW LED controllers.

	  The KTD2026 is a 3-channel constant current LED driver and the KTD2027
	  is a 4-channel variant. Both support individual LED brightness control,
	  hardware PWM blinking, and programmable rise/fall times.

	  Features:
	  - 3 or 4 LED channels with 0-24mA current (0.125mA steps)
	  - Hardware PWM blinking with configurable period and duty cycle
	  - Programmable rise/fall times for smooth transitions
	  - I2C interface (address 0x30, 0x31, or 0x32 depending on variant)
